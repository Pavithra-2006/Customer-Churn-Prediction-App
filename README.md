Project Overview:

Customer retention is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses. This project focuses on building a Customer Churn Prediction Web Application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical subscription and usage data.
The application demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Objectives:

Analyze customer subscription data to identify churn patterns
Train a machine learning model to predict customer churn
Deploy the trained model as a web application for real-time predictions

Dataset:

Name: Subscription Service Churn Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Size: 1000+ samples
The dataset includes customer-related attributes such as subscription details, service usage, and churn labels.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib
Web Framework: Streamlit

Machine Learning Workflow:

Data loading and preprocessing
Feature selection and transformation
Model training using Scikit-learn
Model evaluation and validation
Model serialization using Joblib
Deployment using Streamlit

Application Features:

User-friendly interface for inputting customer details
Real-time churn prediction using a trained ML model
Lightweight and interactive web deployment
